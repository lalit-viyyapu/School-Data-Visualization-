# School Data Visualization

## Description
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing school application data from an aggregator website, with the goal of gaining insights into various aspects of school applications. The dataset contains information about 10,000 applicants across multiple schools, including fields such as application date, school name, rating, tuition fee, and acceptance rate.

The project utilizes Python libraries like `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib` to process and visualize the data. Key analyses include exploring missing data, filling in missing values with appropriate strategies (e.g., using median for numerical fields), and performing various types of visualizations such as bar charts, boxplots, line plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps. The visualizations offer insights into tuition fees, acceptance rates, and ratings across schools and majors, helping to reveal patterns and trends such as the relationship between tuition fees and acceptance rates.

This project demonstrates how data can be effectively cleaned, processed, and visualized to provide actionable insights into school applications, making it a useful tool for decision-making in educational contexts.
